      The configuration supports userinfo as part of the URI for password protected Redis nodes. The format is "redis://:password@redis.example.com:portnumber". If portnumber is not specified, the default port 6379 is used. The built-in support for Redis does currently not allow connections to multiple Redis nodes, nor does it support the failoverNodes property. However, with Redis, automatic failover could be implemented directly in Redis by building a Redis cluster. For example, Amazon ElastiCache for Redis implements a failover mode which constantly replicates all data from the primary node to one or more slaves, then, if the master goes down, promotes another node to be the master and in the process changes the DNS entry of the primary node to point to the new master. MSM supports this mode by automatically reconnecting to the Redis server when the connection goes down, potentially picking up the new DNS settings and therefore connecting to the new master. In the future, support for Redis Sentinel or Redis Cluster may be added.
